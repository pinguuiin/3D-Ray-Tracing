# The last element for camera, FOV,  should be an integer between 0 and 180;
# Here it is a floating point number.
# Since parsing expects an integer value, it parses only the whole number part,
# and it stops there; Then, parsing does not expect (and does not accept)
# anything but whitespace until the end of the line -> in this case, it detects
# the "." following the whole number, and returns an error.
